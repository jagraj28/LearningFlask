# LearningFlask
Learning how to use the Flask framework within Python.
From the Corey Schafer YouTube series, I learnt how to create a blog webpage with the following lessons:

1. Getting Started - Downloading and Setting Up Flask within VS Code.
2. Templates - Creating html files for separate pieces of the program such as the home page, account page and login page.
3. Forms and Input - Designing and inserting forms for users to create accounts and interact with the webpage, error checking included.
4. Database - The SQLAlchemy Flash module was installed and used to mimic a database for the user information to be stored.
5. Package Structure - Project restructured into a single package to help importing modules across the application.
6. User Authentication - Improving the login service so users are added to the database and can log in and out.
7. User Account Page - Adding a profile picture for user accounts as well as being able to update blog posts.
8. Create, Update and Delete Posts - Allowing the user to do more with the webpage with more functionality for posts.
9. Pagination - Implementing page number buttons and sorting posts from newest to oldest.
10. Email and Password Reset - Creating new routes within the program so the user can request a password reset email and log in.
